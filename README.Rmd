This dragon animation was created for my graphics class.<br />

To see a video of the animation, view 304438802.mov.<br />

We were given some template code for the project. My work consists of the following:<br />
-The class "Project 2" under example-scene-components.js. This is the bulk of my animation code.<br />
-The shapes Wing_Tip, Wing_Base, Body_Segment, Tail, Fire, Head, and Jaw under example-shapes.js. These were custom shapes I made (with customized vertices, normals, and texture coordinates).
