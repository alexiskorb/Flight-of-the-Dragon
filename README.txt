1. Overview: 
My project is an animation of a dragon running off of a cliff, flying through the air, 
doing a barrel roll, doing a front roll, and then breathing fire.

2. Starting the Animation
-The animation is located under the link "Project_2" in template-demo.html.
-This is in the same general location as the "Bee Scene" (but just renamed).
-Start the animation by pressing Alt-A.

3. Shapes 
(These can be found in the example-shapes.js file.)
-Custom Shapes: 
*I made these shapes entirely from scratch with novel positions, normals, and texture coordinates. 
	-Dragon head
	-The two parts of the dragon wing
	-All dragon body segments
-Composite Shapes:
*I made these shapes from the given Closed_Cone shapes
	-Tail endpiece
	-Fire

4. Textures
-To texture my scene, I used images from the following websites:
	-Clouds: http://www.sharecg.com/v/3852/favorite/6/Texture/spherical-sky-map!
	-Green Scales: http://www.myfreetextures.com/four-dragon-scale-background-textures/
	-Ground: https://freestocktextures.com/texture/grass-ground-green,785.html
-Custom texture coordinates can be found on all of my custom shapes (not including the composite shapes).
-All of these custom shapes are flat-shaded. 
-A good example of a texture image mapped onto a custom shape and flat-shaded is the head of the dragon.
 I have mapped the green scales image onto the dragon's head.

5. Other Project Requirements:
-Hierarchial Objects:
	-My dragon has a lot more than 3 levels of hierarchy.
	-Some examples of hierarchy are the different segments of the tail and the different parts of the neck and head.
-Camera Tracking:
	-The camera pans around my dragon in the beginning.
	-The camera tracks my dragon as it moves.
-Real-time Speed:
	-My dragon and camera move at reasonable speeds throughout the scene.
-Frame Rate:
	-The frame rate is displayed in the lower left hand corner of the debug screen (which shows up when "T" is pressed).
-Complexity:
	-My dragon model took a lot of time to design and build and is made of a lot of complex, custom shapes.
	-There are many different parts to the animation, and the dragon performs several different actions.
	-Some of the dragon animations are complex.
		-the tail swing has tail pieces rotating slightly out of sync with each other to give a more realistic feel
		-the rotation of the dragon during the barrel roll starts from the head and then ripples down the body
		-etc.

6. Movie and Competition:
I am submiting my project for the competition and have included a video.
